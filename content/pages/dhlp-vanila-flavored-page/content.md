# Patching Philosophy 

Some level of patching is always necessary.

In the case of DHLP, all patches are incorporated into a publicly auditable build process for transparency. 

Outside of security-related patching, DHLP utilizes minimal patching of upstream sources in an auditable fashion, ensuring you get the unadulterated F/OSS components you desire.
