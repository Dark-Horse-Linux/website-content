# Patching Philosophy 

Some level of patching is necessary. 

In the case of DHLP, all patches are incorporated into a publicly auditable build process to ensure transparency and trust overall.

Outside of security-related patching, DHLP utilizes minimal patching of upstream sources in an auditable fashion, ensuring you get the unadulterated F/OSS components you desire.
