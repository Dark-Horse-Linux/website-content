# Free From Controlling Interests

While still providing the full Linux/GNU environment you are accustomed to, such as SystemD, glibc, GCC -- Dark Horse Linux is not based on another Linux distribution, and so is not beholden to any upstream projects' influence in any capacity -- because no such project exists.

# Still Standards Compliant

Dark Horse Linux is FHS 3.0 and LSB 5 compliant, and intends to implement FIPS 140-3 compliance.  


Other relevant standards will be added as the project matures.
