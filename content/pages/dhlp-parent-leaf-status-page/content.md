# Free From Controlling Interests

While still providing the full Linux/GNU environment you are accustomed to such as SystemD, glibc, and GCC -- Dark Horse Linux is not based on another Linux distribution, and so is not beholden to any upstream project's influence in any capacity. This mitigates risk factors of uncertainty caused by dependency on an upstream project if that upstream project disappears or goes rogue.

# Still Standards Compliant

Dark Horse Linux is currently FHS 3.0 and LSB5 compliant. We intend to implement FIPS 140-3 compliance in the future. 


As the project matures we will strive to be compliant with additional relevant standards.
